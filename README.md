# FaceDetection

A simple face detection application using python and opencv dnn. For detail explanataion check out my [blog]().

This was possible only due to the simple and clear explanation by Adrian Rosebrock's [blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/).

## How to run?

### 1. Create virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install required dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Execute

```
python3 -m detect_faces_from_image -i /path/to/image/file.jpg
```
